> **Experimental** — This repository is fully maintained by AI (Claude). It serves as an experiment in autonomous AI-driven open-source development.

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that exposes Nextcloud APIs as tools for AI assistants. Connect any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.) to your Nextcloud instance and let AI manage your files, calendar, contacts, conversations, and more.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install nc-mcp-server
```

Set environment variables and connect:

```bash
export NEXTCLOUD_URL=https://your-nextcloud.example.com
export NEXTCLOUD_USER=your-username
export NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your-app-password
nc-mcp-server
```

## 126 Tools Across 22 Nextcloud Apps

A 127th tool, `upload_file_from_path`, is registered only when the operator sets
`NEXTCLOUD_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT`. See [Files](#files) for details.

| Category | Tools | Protocol |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [Files](#files) | list, read, search, upload (text / binary / from path), copy, move, delete | WebDAV |
| [File Sharing](#file-sharing) | list, get, create, update, delete shares | OCS |
| [Trashbin](#trashbin) | list, restore, delete item, empty trash | WebDAV |
| [File Versions](#file-versions) | list, restore versions | WebDAV |
| [File Comments](#file-comments) | list, add, edit, delete comments | WebDAV |
| [File Reminders](#file-reminders) | get, set, remove per-file reminders | OCS |
| [System Tags](#system-tags) | list, create, assign, unassign, delete tags | WebDAV |
| [Users](#users) | get current, list, get, create, delete users | OCS |
| [User Status](#user-status) | get, set, clear status | OCS |
| [Notifications](#notifications) | list, dismiss one, dismiss all | OCS |
| [Activity](#activity) | get activity feed with filtering | OCS |
| [Talk](#talk) | conversations, messages, participants | OCS |
| [Talk Polls](#talk-polls) | get, create, vote, close polls | OCS |
| [Announcements](#announcements) | list, create, delete announcements | OCS |
| [Calendar](#calendar) | list calendars, CRUD events | CalDAV |
| [Contacts](#contacts) | list address books, CRUD contacts | CardDAV |
| [Tasks](#tasks) | list lists, CRUD tasks, complete | CalDAV |
| [Mail](#mail) | accounts, mailboxes, messages, send | OCS |
| [Collectives](#collectives) | list, pages, create, trash, restore | OCS |
| [Forms](#forms) | CRUD forms, questions, options, shares, submissions + export | OCS |
| [Unified Search](#unified-search) | list providers, search across apps | OCS |
| [App Management](#app-management) | list, info, enable, disable apps | OCS |

## Security: Permission Model

Every tool has a required permission level. You control what the AI is allowed to do:

| Level | What it can do | Environment variable |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| `read` (default) | List files, read files, get users, view notifications | `NEXTCLOUD_MCP_PERMISSIONS=read` |
| `write` | Everything in `read` + upload files, send messages, create events | `NEXTCLOUD_MCP_PERMISSIONS=write` |
| `destructive` | Everything in `write` + delete files, remove shares, empty trash | `NEXTCLOUD_MCP_PERMISSIONS=destructive` |

If a tool is called without sufficient permission, it returns a clear error explaining what permission is needed — no silent failures, no accidental deletions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nc-mcp-server
```

Or with `pipx` / `uvx` for isolated installation:
```bash
pipx install nc-mcp-server
# or
uvx nc-mcp-server
```

Or from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloud-py-api/nc_mcp_server.git
cd nc_mcp_server
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Set these environment variables:

```bash
# Required
export NEXTCLOUD_URL=https://your-nextcloud.example.com
export NEXTCLOUD_USER=your-username
export NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # Use an app password, not your main password!

# Optional
export NEXTCLOUD_MCP_PERMISSIONS=read  # read (default), write, or destructive
export NEXTCLOUD_MCP_RETRY_MAX=3       # max retries on 429/503 (default: 3, 0 to disable)
export NEXTCLOUD_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT=      # unset (default). If set to an absolute directory,
                                       # enables upload_file_from_path, restricted to files
                                       # inside that directory (symlinks resolved).
```

### Getting an App Password

1. Log into your Nextcloud instance
2. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
3. Under "Devices & sessions", create a new app password
4. Use this password for `NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD`

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nextcloud": {
      "command": "nc-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "NEXTCLOUD_URL": "https://your-nextcloud.example.com",
        "NEXTCLOUD_USER": "your-username",
        "NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD": "your-app-password",
        "NEXTCLOUD_MCP_PERMISSIONS": "read"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add nextcloud \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_URL=https://your-nextcloud.example.com \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_USER=your-username \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your-app-password \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_MCP_PERMISSIONS=read \
  -- nc-mcp-server
```

### As HTTP Server (for containers/remote)

```bash
nc-mcp-server --transport http
# Listens on http://0.0.0.0:8100 by default
```

### Stdio Mode (default)

```bash
nc-mcp-server
# Communicates via stdin/stdout — used by MCP clients like Claude Desktop
```

## Available Tools

### Files

| Tool | Permission | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `list_directory` | read | List files and folders in a directory |
| `get_file` | read | Read a file's content (returns images as MCP ImageContent) |
| `search_files` | read | Search files by name, MIME type, or path pattern |
| `upload_file` | write | Upload or overwrite a text file |
| `upload_file_binary` | write | Upload or overwrite a binary file (images, PDFs, archives) from base64-encoded content |
| `upload_file_from_path` | write | Stream a local file from the server's filesystem — only registered when `NEXTCLOUD_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT` is set |
| `create_directory` | write | Create a new directory |
| `copy_file` | write | Copy a file or directory |
| `move_file` | destructive | Move or rename a file |
| `delete_file` | destructive | Delete a file or directory (moves to trash) |

`upload_file_from_path` is off by default because it gives the AI read access
to the local filesystem. To enable it, set `NEXTCLOUD_MCP_UPLOAD_ROOT` to an
absolute directory — only files resolving inside that directory (after symlink
resolution) can be uploaded. This is the right choice when you need to upload
multi-GB files that would blow past the size limit of an inline `base64` tool
call; the body is streamed in chunks rather than loaded into memory.

## About This Project

This project is an experiment in AI-autonomous open-source development. The entire codebase — including this README — is written and maintained by Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). Human oversight is limited to:

- High-level design decisions
- Code review of pull requests
- Resolving architectural questions

The goal is to explore how far autonomous AI development can go in building production-quality, well-tested software.

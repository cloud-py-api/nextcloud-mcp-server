        Activities track what happened across Nextcloud: file changes, shares,
        calendar events, Talk messages, and more.

        Available filters: "all", "self" (your actions), "by" (others' actions),
        "files", "files_sharing", "files_favorites", "calendar", "calendar_todo",
        "comments", "contacts", "deck", "forms", "security", "tables", "circles".

        To get activities for a specific file or object, provide both object_type
        and object_id (e.g., object_type="files", object_id=742).

        Args:
            activity_filter: Activity filter (default: "all"). Use "self" to see only
                    your actions, "by" for actions by others, or an app-specific
                    filter like "files" or "calendar".
            limit: Maximum number of activities to return (1-200, default: 30).
            since: Activity ID to paginate from. Use the smallest activity_id from
                   a previous call to fetch older activities. Default 0 = newest.
            object_type: Filter by object type (e.g., "files"). Must be used
                         together with object_id.
            object_id: Filter by object ID. Must be used together with object_type.
            sort: Sort order: "desc" (newest first, default) or "asc" (oldest first).

        Returns:
            JSON object with "data" (list of activities) and "pagination"
            (count, has_more, since). Use since value for the next page.
